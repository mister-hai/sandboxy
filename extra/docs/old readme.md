# DAILY PLAN

    Working on getting the packer/unpacker/installer/main-menu working
    
    I have gotten a test of the uploading functionality working
    it `should` be complete shortly

# WEEKLY PLAN
    
    PROGRESS:

        ctfcli almost completely rewritten, it uploads challenges, and creates a 
        handout.tar.gz and solution.tar.gz and a masterlist.yaml of all the challenges

        installer semi-funcitonal

        ctfd server operational

        nginx proxy still not scrubbing port number from uri


# PENTEST SANDBOX
    this is an all in one setup script for a docker/kubernetes cluster
    specifically, it creates a pentesting sandbox/ctfd instance

    There are two directories of concern
        
        -sandboxy
            the docker-compose file directory containing the data created by
            CTFd and the users of the platform (mysql,cache,etc) to be packed 
            up and distributed to a replacment system in the event of a server change
            
            /containers
                contains the folders holding dockerfiles and resources for each Container

                /CTFd
                    Contains the build data for the ctfd docker container
                
                /nginx
                    ditto

            /data 
                where the portable data is placed (mysql/redis/ctfd/nginx/etc)

                /certbot/conf/live
                    This is where your certs are, keep an eye on this folder!

                /CTFd/Challenges
                    The challenge repository, managed by a rewrite of ctfcli

## Important Information

    the important files to start with for development are 
        - main-compose.yaml
       
       The "containers" directory has each folder as a seperate docker box
       with its own dockerfile and everything necessary in that folder as 
       the build dir

        for linting/dev, you edit:
            /config/nginx_template.conf

        then you copy that to:
            /containers/nginx/nginx.conf.template

        finally, this file is where you set configuration parameters for the 
        environment:
            ./.env

        ! letsencrypt should be used only if a domain name is available !
                run init_letsencrypt.sh FIRST AND ONLY ONCE!
        ! letsencrypt should be used only if a domain name is available !

        haxnet.yaml is for severe sandboxing
        will contain
            debian cnc
            linux databases
            possibly windows hosts?
                must check legality

# ctfdcli instructions

    THE CHALLENGES MUST BE UPLOADED TO CTFD FIRST BEFORE ACTIVATING THE KCTF ENVIRONMENT

    from anywhere:
        > pip3 install ctfcli
        - I needed to downgrade requests and pyyaml after pip install
    
    in a clean directory, above the sandbox repository:
        ctf init
            - it will ask you for the url of the CTFd competition
            - it will then ask for an access token
                - the token is found in the settings tab of the admin panel
            - it will create an empty git repo in that directory

        ctf challenge add https://github.com/sigpwny/UIUCTF-2021-Public.git
            - will show error, IGNORE IT, lines are added to the 
                ./.ctf/config
            ERROR: fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree. Working tree has modifications.  Cannot add.

    
    EXAMPLE:
        moop@fightbiscuits:~/challengedir$ ctf challenge install ./UIUCTF-2021-Public/jail/baby_python
        Found UIUCTF-2021-Public/jail/baby_python/challenge.yml
        Loaded baby_python
        Installing baby_python
        Success!

# KCTF INSTRUCTIONS
    
    After installing kctf
    in a terminal, in the main project directory
    
        source kctf/activate

            - activates the kctf environment allowing you to upload
                challenge.yaml files from kubernetes deployments

        kctf cluster create local-cluster --start --type kind

            - creates a "kind" cluster, kind is a docker driver
                for kubernetes that has recently been deprecated
                although will remain supporteted as a containerd 
                abstraction
    
    FROM THE MAIN PROJECT DIRECTORY:
        perform the following sort of commands to move the kubernetes 
        challenges to the kctf templates folder
    
        cp -ar ./challengedir/UIUCTF-2021-Public/web/* ./kctf/challenge-templates/
        cp -ar ./challengedir/UIUCTF-2021-Public/pwn/* ./kctf/challenge-templates/

    Now you can create the challenges with kctf
    THE CHALLENGES MUST BE UPLOADED TO CTFD FIRST BEFORE ACTIVATING THE ENVIRONMENT
    This example uses ponydb from the UIUCTF-2021 challenge

        kctf chal create --template ponydb ponydb && cd ponydb
            - creates a folder in the main project directory, alongside kctf and 
                sandboxy and the main repository for CTFd
            - changes shell location to that challenge folder
            - the challenge is created from the template
    
    in that folder run the following command:
    
        kctf chal start

    And you will see the following as output:

        [*] building image in "/home/moop/pwnyide/challenge"
        [*] Image ID "8373-----49fe"
        [*] building image in "/home/moop/pwnyide/healthcheck"
        [*] Image ID "c0b07bb15de------36"
        Image: "kind/challenge:8373f7-----05549fe" with ID "sha256:8373f7b887b741ea-----549fe" not yet present on node "kctf-cluster-control-plane", loading...      
        [*] Image pushed to "kind/challenge:8373f7------549fe"
        Image: "kind/healthcheck:c0b07bb15----337a36" with ID "sha256:c0b----37a36" not yet present on node "kctf-cluster-control-plane", loading...
        [*] Image pushed to "kind/healthcheck:c0b07----337a36"
        challenge.kctf.dev/pwnyide created
    
    CONNECTING TO THE CHALLENGE:
    
    To connect to the challenge, run the following command:

        kctf chal debug port-forward &
    
    You will see the followong output:

        moop@fightbiscuits:~/pwnyide$ kctf chal debug port-forward &
        [1] 131556
        moop@fightbiscuits:~/pwnyide$ [*] starting port-forward, ctrl+c to exit
        Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:42743 -> 1337

## Some Notes

    
    Historically the security of user namespace was uncertain. eg: lwn.net/Articles/673597 . 
    If a user, as root inside her own namespace can trick the kernel into allowing an operation
    on the real host, there's privilege escalation. Usual non-user namespaces require explicit
    root (so admin) permission and so run what the admin chose: that's a known risk. A later
    mechanism was added in vanilla kernel: user.max_user_namespaces . When set to 0 user
    namespaces are disabled. The Debian (actually from Ubuntu) patch is still around, even if
    probably obsolete. Maybe for compatibility reasons – A.B Mar 20 '18 at 14:30
