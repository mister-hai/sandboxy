## Exploit

The model, reflector, and rotors and their positions, of the machine have been given to the players. You just have to use the online [Enigma decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine). You have to use brute force to find out the reflector type and the missing rotors, which you'll find out to be B, I, IV, and VII respectively.
