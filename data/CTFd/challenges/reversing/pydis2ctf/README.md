Disassemble Python byte code and reverse the obtained python code.

# Requirements

- Python 3
- Basic Knowledge of Python Byte Code

## Sources

- [C1cipher](./C1cipher)
- [C2cipher](./C2cipher)

```
I learnt Python in school but I have no clue what this is!
Hint 1: python disassembly is easy  - Points 100
Hint 2: pip install Assembly - Points 200
```

## Exploit

There are two ciphers in [C1cipher](./C1cipher) and [C2cipher](./C2cipher) and you have two convery both the ciphers into python code the solution is in [Solution](./solution.py).

 The flag is:
```
csictf{T#a+_wA5_g0oD_d155aSe^^bLy}
```
