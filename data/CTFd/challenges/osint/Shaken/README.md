## Sources
```
I love this watch. It's been with me all over the world, from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau.I wear it with suits quite a lot. My boss liked it too. I remember wearing it when she died. What is her successor's name?
```


## Exploit

The question mentions wearing the watch in Istanbul, Shanghai and Macau. On searching these locations, the results all show flight tickets but on moving in a few more pages, results for Skyfall start to appear. Even quicker if you put the word movie as part of the search history. The suits, along with the death of the boss all point toward James Bond, namely in Skyfall. Once the person is recognized as James Bond, it becomes easy to find his boss in Skyfall (M), and her successor.

The flag is:
